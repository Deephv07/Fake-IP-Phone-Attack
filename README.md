# ðŸš¨ Fake IP Phone Attack - Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation

This project demonstrates a simulated **Fake IP Phone Attack**, where a malicious device gains unauthorized access to the **Voice VLAN (VLAN 20)** by spoofing itself as an IP phone in a Cisco Packet Tracer environment.

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

- Understand vulnerabilities in Voice VLAN setups.
- Simulate a Fake IP Phone Attack using static IP assignment and switchport reconfiguration.
- Analyze the security risks associated with weak VLAN configurations.
- Explore preventive security measures to protect network segments.

## ðŸª¢ Network Topology

- Router Gig0/0 connected to Switch Gig0/1 (Trunk link)
- IP Phone connected to Switch Fa0/1
- PC1 connected to Switch Fa0/2

---

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Steps

### Switch Configuration
- VLAN 10 (DATA) and VLAN 20 (VOICE) created.
- Fa0/1: Access VLAN 10, Voice VLAN 20.
- Fa0/2: Initially access VLAN 10, modified to simulate fake IP phone.
- Gig0/1: Configured as trunk port.

### Router Configuration (Router-on-a-Stick)
- Subinterfaces configured for VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 with IP addresses.
- DHCP Pools configured for DATA and VOICE VLANs.

### Attack Simulation
- Fa0/2 port modified to include Voice VLAN.
- PC1 manually configured with static IP address from the Voice VLAN (192.168.20.x range).
- PC1 gains access to Voice VLAN traffic.

## âœ… Verification Steps

| Step | Command | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| 1 | `show vlan brief` | Verify VLAN assignments |
| 2 | `show interfaces trunk` | Verify trunk port configuration |
| 3 | `show ip dhcp binding` | Verify DHCP leases |
| 4 | `show ip interface brief` | Verify subinterface status |
| 5 | `show ip route` | Verify routing between VLANs |

Ping tests were successful, confirming spoofed PC1 access to the Voice VLAN.

## ðŸ›¡ Defense Techniques

- Enable **DHCP Snooping**
- Enable **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**
- Configure **Port Security** on access ports
- Disable unused ports and voice VLANs on unauthorized ports
